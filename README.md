I recently developed a Healthcare Analytics Dashboard to analyze patient distribution and treatment costs across departments, doctors, gender, and months. The analysis shows that Neurology has the highest number of patients and also generates the highest treatment revenue, indicating a strong link between patient volume and department income. The total treatment cost is 38M, with male patients contributing slightly more than female patients. Monthly trends reveal peak treatment costs around April and August, while patient visits are higher in January, April, and November, showing seasonal patterns in hospital activity. Doctor-wise analysis highlights consistent performance, with a few doctors generating slightly higher revenue. Overall, this dashboard helps in better resource planning, revenue tracking, and performance monitoring, supporting data-driven decision making in healthcare management.
